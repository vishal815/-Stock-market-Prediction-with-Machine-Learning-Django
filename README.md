## Introduction
<p>
  I created one website rewrite simpale Introducton in one small paragraph"Name= Stock Price Prediction with Machine Learning sing linear regression & Django App. In which 1The Home page of the application that displays real time data of stock prices , 2 To Predict stock price we move on to predicition page where we need to enter valid ticker value and number of days and click predict button. , 3 This page displays the predicted stock price alsong with searched ticker details and also generating unique QR Code to view the predicted result., 4 The Left Graph is the real time stock price of the searched ticker for past 1day & the Right Graph is the predicted stock price for the number of days searched. ,5 The Ticker Info page displays the details of all the valid tickers accepted by the application.
</p>
